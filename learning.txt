I learnt to - Clone a repo*:  By duplicating a GitHub repository to your local machine to work on it offline.
- Editing locally: Made changes to files in your local repo using your preferred tools/editors.
- Syncing changes:
    - `git push`: Send local changes to GitHub.
    - `git pull`: Get updates from GitHub to your local repo.
- Workflow: Clone → Edit locally → Commit → Push to GitHub (sync).
